## Bio

I am James Briggs, a physicist and software engineer in Cambridge, UK.

I currently work as a research software engineer at the University of Cambridge. I work on in big data science/engineering and backend engineering projects with researchers at the university. 
I like playing with data, computer vision, and machine learning.

Out of computers I enjoy travelling, collecting whisky, building memory palaces, and playing mandolin. ;)
