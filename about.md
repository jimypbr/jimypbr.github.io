## Who Am I?

I am James Briggs, a physicist, software engineer and technology enthusiast from Cambridge, UK.
I like to solve problems, build things, break things.

I currently work for the University of Cambridge as a high performance computing software engineer.
I am interested in big data science/engineering, high performance computing, web back-end programming, and functional programming.
