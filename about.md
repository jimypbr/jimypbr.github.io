## Who Am I?

I am James Briggs, a physicist, software engineer and technology enthusiast from Cambridge, UK.
I like to solve problems, build things, break things...

I currently work for the [Stephen Hawking Centre for Theoretical Cosmology](http://www.ctc.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge as a high performance computing software engineer working on [COSMOS](http://www.cosmos.damtp.cam.ac.uk).
Professionally I am interested in big data science/engineering, high performance parallel computing, web programming, and functional programming.

Out of work I enjoy travelling, collecting whisky, building memory palaces, and thrashing bass guitar.
